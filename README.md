# _Kickstarting with Excel_

## Overview of Project
###
 To present visualizations to our client Louise that uncover, trends that present the most opportune time for her to launch a successful campaign for her play "Fever."

 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to begin how to understand the structure of a data set, analyze it and find trends in Excel by using tools such as:

- **Conditional Formatting** - add visual components to the dataset
- **Filter** - Analyze the data more Effiecently and Precisely  
- **Funtions** - to **_pull_** specific data and perform calculations
- **Visualizations** - by creating piviot tables and charts to help tell the story of trends in the data 

## Analysis and Challenges
<br>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

>The image above shows the correlation of finacial goals met based on the month the campaigns were launched. <br>Utilizing the the filters in the piviot table created, this chart pin points a specific parent catergorty; theaters. Reducing the data set to this catergory allowed for the data to be within the same general scope as Louises _play_ and present data of a similar target market. <br>  With this visualization, we can make the educated assumption that starting a campaign in the month of May yeilds the highest chance for Louise's campaign goals succeed.  


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

>   The image above shows 12 different price points and the perecentage diffences between, successful campaigns, failed campaigns and canceled campaigns. Specifically for the subcatergory **_"Plays"_**  <br>  With this visualization, we can say that Louise's campaign goal of roughly $4000 Euro has a 73% change of success. Based on this chart we can also determine that as campaign goals increased the success rate decreased.  


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Trying to edit funtions copied into additonals columns. What was happening was, for example, the countif() I would forget to hit F4 to lock the reference column and have to go back through and edit the function all over again. 
- Referencing back to another workbook. It seemed that if I tried to type in my refernce and column into the function for lets say VLOOKUP() I would get and error. I worked around this by no longer typing in the reference but by clicking the work book and then the column I was trying to reference. 

## Results

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

- In my opinion the limitation of a data set is subjective to the person anylzing it and how well they can break down the data to uncover the trends.
- Aside from that one limitation to this data set specifically is that the most recent data is 5 years old. Therefore our trends may no longer be inline with the current market or success of campaigns in recent years.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
<br>

- A Box and whisker chart could be presented if Louise would happen to request for additional infromation on how reliable the data was and to be rest assured that no outliers had skewed the data set.
